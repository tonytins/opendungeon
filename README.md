# Open Dungeon

Welcome to **Open Dungeon**! This project is a treasure trove of JSON files crafted for enhancing your adventures in AI Dungeon, all based on original lore. Dive into a world where your choices shape the story, and every turn holds the potential for new discoveries.

## Getting Started

To integrate Open Dungeon into your game, follow these simple steps:

1. **Minify** your JSON files using a reliable tool.
2. Place the minified JSON in the **Story Cards** section or the **Backstory Module** of AI Dungeon:
   - For **Story Cards**: Add them to your library for quick access during gameplay.
   - For **Backstory**: Assign them to your **Player Character** to enrich your personal narrative.

## Compatibility

- **Mixtral Model**: Premium model, recommend for JSON handling and scripting.
- **MythoMax Model**: Free version with variable performance; version **0.18** is recommended over **0.19** for better compatibility.
- **Tiefighter Model**: Experimental and showing promise. Currently on par with MythoMax, but improvements are expected.
